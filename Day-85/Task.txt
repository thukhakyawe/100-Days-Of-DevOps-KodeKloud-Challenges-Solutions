a. Create an inventory file ~/playbook/inventory on jump host and include all app servers.

b. Create a playbook ~/playbook/playbook.yml to create a blank file /opt/nfsshare.txt on all app servers.

c. Set the permissions of the /opt/nfsshare.txt file to 0655.

d. Ensure the user/group owner of the /opt/nfsshare.txt file is tony on app server 1, steve on app server 2 and banner on app server 3.

Note: Validation will execute the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so ensure the playbook functions correctly without any additional arguments.

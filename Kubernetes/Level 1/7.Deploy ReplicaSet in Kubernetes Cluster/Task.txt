The Nautilus DevOps team is gearing up to deploy applications on a Kubernetes cluster for migration purposes. A team member has been tasked with creating a ReplicaSet outlined below:


    Create a ReplicaSet using httpd image with latest tag (ensure to specify as httpd:latest) and name it httpd-replicaset.

    Apply labels: app as httpd_app, type as front-end.

    Name the container httpd-container. Ensure the replica count is 4.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.



The Nautilus DevOps team is crafting jobs in the Kubernetes cluster. While they're developing actual scripts/commands, they're currently setting up templates and testing jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:

    Create a job named countdown-xfusion.

    The spec template should be named countdown-xfusion (under metadata), and the container should be named container-countdown-xfusion

    Utilize image debian with latest tag (ensure to specify as debian:latest), and set the restart policy to Never.

    Execute the command sleep 5

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.



The Nautilus DevOps team is establishing a ReplicationController to deploy multiple pods for hosting applications that require a highly available infrastructure. Follow the specifications below to create the ReplicationController:

    Create a ReplicationController using the httpd image with latest tag, and name it httpd-replicationcontroller.

    Assign labels app as httpd_app, and type as front-end. Ensure the container is named httpd-container and set the replica count to 3.

All pods should be running state post-deployment.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.

The existing setup includes a deployment named nginx-deployment and a service named nginx-service. Below are the necessary changes to be implemented without deleting the deployment and service:

1.) Modify the service nodeport from 30008 to 32165

2.) Change the replicas count from 1 to 5

3.) Update the image from nginx:1.18 to nginx:latest

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.

🧠 Part 2: Simple Step-by-Step Explanation (Beginner Friendly)
🪜 What are we doing?

We are:

Logging into Application Server 1

Creating a container

Making sure it keeps running

🔍 Command Breakdown
docker run -d --name nginx_1 nginx:alpine


docker run → create + start a container

-d → detached mode (runs in background)

--name nginx_1 → exact container name required by lab

nginx:alpine → nginx image, lightweight alpine version

If -d is missing → container may stop → lab fails.

🧠 Exam Memory Hook

Right server → Right name → Right image → Running

Always verify with:

docker ps

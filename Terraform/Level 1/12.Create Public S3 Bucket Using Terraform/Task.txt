Given the ongoing migration of other infrastructure to AWS, it is logical to consolidate data storage within the AWS environment as well.

    Create a public S3 bucket named devops-s3-17460 using Terraform.

    Ensure the bucket is accessible publicly once created by setting the proper ACL.

    The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Notes:

    Create the resources only in the us-east-1 region.
    Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.
    The name of the S3 bucket should be based on devops-s3-17460.
    You can use the ACL settings to ensure the bucket is publicly accessible.

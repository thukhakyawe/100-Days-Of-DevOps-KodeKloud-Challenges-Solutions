The Nautilus DevOps team is working on automating infrastructure deployment using AWS CloudFormation. As part of this effort, they need to create a CloudFormation stack that provisions an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.

Create a CloudFormation stack named nautilus-stack using Terraform. This stack should contain an S3 bucket named nautilus-bucket-18142 as a resource, and the bucket must have versioning enabled. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

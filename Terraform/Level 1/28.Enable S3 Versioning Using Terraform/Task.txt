The DevOps team has received a requirement for implementing such measures for one of the S3 buckets they are managing.

The S3 bucket name is datacenter-s3-9431, enable versioning for this bucket using Terraform.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Update the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

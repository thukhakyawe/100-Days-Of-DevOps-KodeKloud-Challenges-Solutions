

The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up a DynamoDB table for storing user data. They need to create a DynamoDB table with the following specifications:

1) The table name should be nautilus-users.

2) The primary key should be nautilus_id (String).

3) The table should use PAY_PER_REQUEST billing mode.

Use Terraform to create this DynamoDB table. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to create the DynamoDB table.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

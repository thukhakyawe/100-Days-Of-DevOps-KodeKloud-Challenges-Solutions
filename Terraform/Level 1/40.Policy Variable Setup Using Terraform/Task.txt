For this task, create an AWS IAM policy using Terraform with the following requirements:

    The IAM policy name iampolicy_ammar should be stored in a variable named KKE_iampolicy.

Note:

    The configuration values should be stored in a variables.tf file.

    The Terraform script should be structured with a main.tf file referencing variables.tf.

    The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

    Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

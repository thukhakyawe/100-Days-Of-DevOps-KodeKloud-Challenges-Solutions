Create a snapshot of an existing volume named nautilus-vol in us-east-1 region using terraform.

1) The name of the snapshot must be nautilus-vol-ss.

2) The description must be Nautilus Snapshot.

3) Make sure the snapshot status is completed before submitting the task.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Update the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

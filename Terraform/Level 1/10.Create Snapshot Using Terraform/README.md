To deploy this configuration:

Navigate to the Terraform directory:

```
cd /home/bob/terraform
```

Initialize Terraform:

```
terraform init
```

Output

```
bob@iac-server ~/terraform via ðŸ’  default âžœ  terraform init
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v5.91.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Plan the deployment to verify the configuration:

```
terraform plan
```

Output

```

Apply the configuration:

Then type `yes` when prompted to confirm the creation of the snapshot.

S3 bucket named datacenter-cp-13069 already exists. Copy the file /tmp/datacenter.txt to s3 bucket datacenter-cp-13069 using Terraform. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Update the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

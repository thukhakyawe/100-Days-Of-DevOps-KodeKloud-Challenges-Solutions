For this task, create an AWS IAM role using Terraform with the following requirements:

    The IAM role name iamrole_anita should be stored in a variable named KKE_iamrole.

Note:
1. The configuration values should be stored in a variables.tf file.

2. The Terraform script should be structured with a main.tf file referencing variables.tf.

    The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

    Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

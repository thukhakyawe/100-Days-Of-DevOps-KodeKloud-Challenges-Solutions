As part of the migration process, several resources were created for one-time use only, necessitating a cleanup effort to optimize their AWS environment.

A S3 bucket named nautilus-bck-29479 already exists.

1) Copy the contents of nautilus-bck-29479 S3 bucket to /opt/s3-backup/ directory on terraform-client host (the landing host once you load this lab).

2) Delete the S3 bucket nautilus-bck-29479.

3) Use the AWS CLI through Terraform to accomplish this task—for example, by running AWS CLI commands within Terraform. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Update the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

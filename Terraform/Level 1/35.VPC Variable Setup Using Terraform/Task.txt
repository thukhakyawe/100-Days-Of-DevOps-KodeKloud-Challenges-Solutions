

The Nautilus DevOps team is automating VPC creation using Terraform to manage networking efficiently. As part of this task, they need to create a VPC with specific requirements.

For this task, create an AWS VPC using Terraform with the following requirements:

    The VPC name xfusion-vpc should be stored in a variable named KKE_vpc.

    The VPC should have a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16.

Note:

    The configuration values should be stored in a variables.tf file.

    The Terraform script should be structured with a main.tf file referencing variables.tf.

    The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

    Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

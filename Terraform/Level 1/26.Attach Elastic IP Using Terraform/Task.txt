They have been breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process. Recently they came up with requirements mentioned below.

There is an instance named devops-ec2 and an elastic-ip named devops-ec2-eip in us-east-1 region. Attach the devops-ec2-eip elastic-ip to the devops-ec2 instance using Terraform only. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Update the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to attach the specified Elastic IP to the instance.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

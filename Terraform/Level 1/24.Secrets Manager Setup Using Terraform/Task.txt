

The Nautilus DevOps team needs to store sensitive data securely using AWS Secrets Manager. They need to create a secret with the following specifications:

1) The secret name should be xfusion-secret.

2) The secret value should contain a key-value pair with username: admin and password: Namin123.

3) Use Terraform to create the secret in AWS Secrets Manager.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

The Nautilus DevOps Team has received a new request from the Development Team to set up a new EC2 instance. This instance will be used to host a new application that requires a stable IP address. To ensure that the instance has a consistent public IP, an Elastic IP address needs to be associated with it. This setup will help the Development Team to have a reliable and consistent access point for their application.

    Create an EC2 instance named xfusion-ec2 using any Linux AMI like Ubuntu.

    Instance type must be t2.micro and associate an Elastic IP address named xfusion-eipwith this instance.

    Use the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to provision the EC2-Instance and Elastic IP.

    Use the outputs.tf file and output the instance name using variable KKE_instance_name and the Elastic IP using variable KKE_eip.
